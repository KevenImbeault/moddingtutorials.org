## Explanation 

This is a series of tutorials on how to make a mod for minecraft 1.15.2 with Forge.  

You can select a tutorial at the top of this page and jump to whatever topic you're looking for 
or click the next button at the bottom of the page and go though in order. If you're a beginner you should definitely go in order. 

I make these because I was frustrated by the lack of documentation / useable tutorials for Forge. All the tutorials I could find 
were extremely long videos of someone talking extreamly slowly. I hope to offer an alternative with quick videos and text versions 
for those who don't need to a visual follow along. Hopefully my tutorials will be less painful to refer to if you happen to 
forget something.
