# Why Long Videos? (a history lesson)

## August 2020

When I started making tutorials last year, I made videos. The goal was not to waste people's time so they were very short and tightly edited. This meant they took a lot of effort to make. I had to record myself creating the feature, write a script for the voiceover explanation, record that, edit down the footage to the same length as the voiceover cutting out any mistakes or dead space. This process took a few hours for just a 5 minute video. The result was something I was proud of and would be helpful to more experienced programmers who just want an overview of forge's features, not to watch me type out everything. However, they were hard for beginners to follow.

After a while, I decided to make new tutorials for 1.16.5 but this time in text format. I paid a few bucks for the blogging service Ghost to host them. Text tutorials have many advantages. They're easier to make because they don't require any recording or tedious editing. And for the reader, they're searchable and you can skim thorough them if you're just looking back for a reference on how to do something specific. I'm always frustrated when I'm trying to learn something and the only option is to watch a video, reading is just so much easier. Perhaps the biggest advantage of the text format is that they can be edited. If I notice a mistake in a past youtube video, I can't make any changes without completely reuploading the video and even if I could, editing to make the corrections would be more work than feels reasonable. The best I could do is a note in the description or a pinned comment. With a text tutorial, I can just edit the website, any past links to it still work and new readers get the updated information. One problem remained, I still worried that beginners would find the tutorials hard to follow. Without a visual aid, I'm not confident my explications are detailed enough for beginners to easily know what to do with each code snippet.

- new cloudflare site. i can make the site look exactly how i want
- slow videos as well for new programmers or anyone who would prefer a visual aid
- videos get more new people

The best part of having a website like this is that I can quickly update tutorials or make pages that answer specific questions from [my discord server](https://discord.com/invite/VbZVnRd). If one person has a question, its quite likely that other people would benefit from answer as well. By putting them on the site in a searchable format, I can prevent them from getting lost in the discord message history and make sure they're available for anyone who goes looking.
