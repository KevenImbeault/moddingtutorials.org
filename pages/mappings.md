## Switching Mappings

### Discord Bot

### Gradle Script

If you need to change the mappings used by your entire project, it would take forever to do manually. Luckily there are gradle scripts that can do this for you. Forge provides the `updateMappings` task to update your method names and `Forge-Class-Remapper` by SizableShrimp can update your class names. How to use both these scripts is covered in [the updating to 1.17 tutorial](/o17/updating).
