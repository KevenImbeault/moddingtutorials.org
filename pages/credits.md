## Resources

- I originally learned how to make mods from TurtyWurty's (almost unbearably slow) [1.15 tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaevjqy3XufYmltqo0eQusnkKVN7MpTUe)
- The class name update script that makes it easy to update from 1.16 to 1.17 is by [SizableShrimp](https://github.com/SizableShrimp)
- Learn about the 1.16 changes to world gen from [TelepathicGrunt](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt)
- The [forge docs](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/1.16.x/) don't cover everything but they're where I learned networking, loot modifiers, and capabilities
- I learned how to do configs and GUIs from GreenOne
- If you're interested in making Fabric mods instead, [the fabric wiki](https://fabricmc.net/wiki) is a great place to start. If I have time, I plan to make tutorials on this eventually.
