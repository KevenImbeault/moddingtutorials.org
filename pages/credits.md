## Resources

- I originally learned how to make mods from TurtyWurty's (almost unbearably slow) [1.15 tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaevjqy3XufYmltqo0eQusnkKVN7MpTUe)
- The class name update script that makes it easy to update from 1.16 to 1.17 is by [SizableShrimp](https://github.com/SizableShrimp)
- Learn about the 1.16 changes to world gen from [TelepathicGrunt](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt)
- The patchouli mod for making guide books is by [Vazkii](https://www.patreon.com/Vazkii)
- The [forge docs](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/1.16.x/) don't cover everything but they're where I learned networking, loot modifiers, and capabilities
- I learned how to do configs and GUIs from GreenOne
- I plan to look through  https://github.com/TheGreyGhost/MinecraftByExample and see if there's anything I should turn into my style of tutorial
- The minecraft font I use for video thumbnails is from [textcraft.net](https://textcraft.net/)
- plan to figure out how shaders work from https://github.com/FINDERFEED/SolarCraftRepository/tree/master/src/main/java/com/finderfeed/solarforge/client/rendering/shaders
- If you're interested in making Fabric mods instead, [the fabric wiki](https://fabricmc.net/wiki) is a great place to start. If I have time, I plan to make tutorials on this eventually.
