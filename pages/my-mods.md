# My Mods

I've made several mods you might find interesting. Most are open source (MIT license) so you can check out the code if you're curious how anything was done.

## Mimic

The mimic is a stealthy new mob that spawns in naturally generated structures and pretends to be a chest. When you try to open it, you'll be attacked. They can also be tamed and used as portable storage. Forge 1.16.5

## Harder Core
