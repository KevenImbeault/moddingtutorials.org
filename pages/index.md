# Minecraft Modding Tutorials

Welcome! This site has tutorials for making Minecraft mods with Forge 1.16.5 and Forge 1.17.1. You can use the yellow drop down menu on the left to switch versions. The source code for all my tutorials can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/LukeGrahamLandryMC/modding-tutorials).

## About

I make these because I was frustrated by the lack of documentation and useable tutorials for Forge. All the tutorials I could find were long videos of someone talking extremely slowly. I hope to offer an alternative: text tutorials for those who don't need to a visual follow along. Hopefully my tutorials will be less painful to refer to if you happen to forget something.

If you're interested in the history of this site, you can read [The Changelog](changelog).

## Contact

If you have any questions or feedback about my tutorials, please [join my discord server](https://discord.com/invite/uG4DewBcwV). We've got a growing community that can help you out with any problems you may have. This is also where I notify people when new tutorials are released. 

## Commissions 

If you have an idea for a mod and would like to commission me to make it a reality, DM me on discord (LukeGrahamLandry#6888). Please prepare a detailed description of the features you want so I can give you a meaningful quote. I will require a 30% deposit before I begin work. Due to time constraints, no commissions under $100 will be taken. I'm happy to work in versions 1.18.x, 1.17.x or 1.16.x on Forge or Fabric. You can take a look at [my mods](my-mods) for some examples of my past work. 

I also offer one-on-one tutoring. Want real time personalized help learning to make Minecraft mods? 
Get on a video call with me, share your screen and I'll guide you through making anything you can imagine. 
DM me on discord (LukeGrahamLandry#6888) and we'll find a time that works for both of us. Fee: $30/hour
