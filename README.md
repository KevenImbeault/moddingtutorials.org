# Modding Tutorials Website

Code for my Minecraft modding tutorial website. View the tutorials online at [moddingtutorials.org](https://moddingtutorials.org). New tutorials are made for 1.19.3, 1.19.2, 1.18.2, and 1.16.5. The code for the tutorial mod is in another repo: [LukeGrahamLandry/modding-tutorials](https://github.com/LukeGrahamLandry/modding-tutorials). Goals of the project are to provide a reference for when I forget things and have good enough SEO that I can get new clients without MMD.
