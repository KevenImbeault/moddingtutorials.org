# Should You Make Custom Minecraft Launcher?

## Positives

- makes it easy for players to install your mod pack so lower support burden for you
- your pack might be more sticky, if someone already has your launcher installed they might be more likely to play again instead of bothering with installing something else
- require specific client mods. you might have mods that arent actually required to connect to your server but all players should use to keep a level playing field. for example, the use of client mods that give a disadvantage like Total Darkness could be enforced. 
- automatically update your modpack 
- build a sense of community. have links to your projects discord, youtube, etc and display news about your work in the launcher that users might not see otherwise. 

## Negatives 

- players have to trust you enough to run your executable. giving an expectation that its normal is bad for security in the future
- players might be annoyed by needing multiple launchers 
- expensive
