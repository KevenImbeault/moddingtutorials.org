# Monetize Your Minecraft Server

you've heard of the basics, 
- ask for donations: most people dont give something for nothing
- charge a fee: plenty of free to play servers to compete with
- sell ranks that give powerful items: banned by eula 
- sponserships or advertisements: ingame ads banned by eula

Sell cosmetics instead
- easy to set up online store

Only problem is that displaying these cosmetics to users will require them to install a mod.
- if you already run a forge/fabric server, you can easily add your cosmetics mod to your mod pack, problem solved
- if you want to make it easier for inexperienced users to install your client mod, you can distribute your own version of the game launcher that bundles everything together so your users can install your mods and connect to your server in a couple clicks. these modded clients can still connect to vanilla servers, no infrastructure changes needed.
- even if your server needs spigot plugins so you can't run on forge/fabric, these modded clients can still connect properly.
