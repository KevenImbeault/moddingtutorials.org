# About This Mirror

This section mirrors some well written modding resources that I reference from my tutorials. 

- Content in this section is not mine. It is copyright its original authors and made available under the license they specified (see header on each page).
- I've been careful to only take things that specify a permissive license. Please [contact me](/discord) if you think I've made a mistake. 
- I've set the canonical link for each page to its source url so my pages shouldn't show up in google. Any SEO benefits should be going to the original author's page.
- I still prefer linking to the original sites in my tutorials. This just exists as a backup; if they get taken down I can easily switch.
