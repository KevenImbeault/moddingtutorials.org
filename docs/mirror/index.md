# About This Mirror

- I think I've been careful to only take those that specify a permissive license. Please [contact me](/discord) if you think I've made a mistake. 
- I've set the canonical link for each page to its source url so my pages shouldn't show up in google. Any SEO benefits should be going to the original author's page.
- I still prefer linking to the original sites in my tutorials. This just exists as a backup; if they go down I can easily switch.
