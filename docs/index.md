# Forge Modding Tutorials 

This site will teach you how to make Minecraft mods for the [Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge) mod loader.

I make these because I was frustrated by the lack of documentation and useable tutorials for Forge. 
All the tutorials I could find were long videos of someone talking extremely slowly. 
I hope to offer an alternative: text tutorials for those who don't need a visual to follow along. 
Hopefully my tutorials will be less painful to refer to if you happen to forget something.

- If this is your first time modding you should probably follow the tutorials in order. 
- New tutorials will be created for 1.16.5, 1.18.2, 1.19.2, and 1.19.3. 
- It's entirely possible that there will be small mistakes in porting the tutorial text between versions. If you notice any, please [let me know](/discord)! 
- The source code for the tutorial mod is at [LukeGrahamLandry/modding-tutorials](/github). 
- Any of my code in the tutorials is public domain. Feel free to use it in your own projects.
- If you find these helpful, consider donating on [Patreon](/patreon).
