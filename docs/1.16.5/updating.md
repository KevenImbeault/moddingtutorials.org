## Changes 

The main difference between 1.15 and 1.16 is that a lot of the world gen code moved to [data packs](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Data_pack). Instead of simply extending classes like Biome, Dimension, etc, they are loaded dynamically from json files. 


This page is a stub. If you would like to add specific instructions to update a mod to 1.16, please [contact me](/discord)!
