# Forge Dev Environment on Apple Silicon 

There used to be a bunch of hoops to jump through but I'm pretty sure the latest versions of forge for most recent versions will just work on m1 chips. Just go download a JDK compiled natively for arm64 and it will be massively faster than emulating with Rosetta 2. Make sure you get the right java version for your mc version! https://www.azul.com/downloads/?os=macos&architecture=arm-64-bit&package=jdk#download-openjdk
