# Minecraft Mod Documentation

## For Players 

This site aims to increase the discoverability of features in minecraft mods. We host documentation for a variety of open source mods to give players a trusted source of detailed explanations of how mods work.

## For Developers

If you're the developer of a simple open source mod, I'd be happy to help document it! Send me a link to your mod's github page and I'll write you some free documentaion. With the added benefit of your mod being added to the site's side bar for discoverability by readers of other mod docs. 

**Why is this service free?**  
I'll host the docs I write on this site and ask that you link to it from your curseforge page. When people click through to read about your mod, there's a chance they'll be interested in the little ad for my mod commissions on the left of the page. 
Your documentation page will never have any third party ads!
