This is the mod created during the modding tutorials on this site. It has the same features for 1.16.5, 1.17.1, 1.18.2, and 1.19 so you can see the differences in code between these versions. 

- Epic Staff of Teleportation: right click to teleport forward 15 blocks (3 second cooldown)
- Cherry: eat for a 50% chance of fire resistance for 10 seconds
- Smiley Face and Smiley Block: no interesting functionality 
- Fancy Blue Coal: a furnace fuel that smelts twice as much as coal
- Pink Tools and Armor set: better than diamond. repaired in anvil with Smiley Faces
- Flaming Chestplate: grants fire resistance and reduces damage taken by 50% and applies that blocked damage to the attacker, setting them on fire for 4 seconds. 
- Sad Block: explodes when right clicked with gun powder (can chain react). valid farm land for cacti and spawns them above it at random intervals. 
- Mob Slayer: deals a heart of damage to non-player entities within 5 blocks every second. Right click to toggle on and off. 
- Explosive Arrow: can be shot from bows and crossbows. explodes when it hits something.
- Bridging Enchantment: replaces air below you with slime blocks while sneaking. goes on boots.
