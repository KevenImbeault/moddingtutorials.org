# I'll Maintain Your Minecraft Mod!

## Offer

- i'll keep updating your mod for new MC versions
- i'll port your mod to multiloader (build for forge and fabric from one code base)
- i'll write documentation on the mod's features, config and developer facing APIs

## Requirements

- be for MC 1.15 or later (forge/fabric/quilt)
- don't have world generation stuff 
- use an open source license (MIT, Apache, LGPL, CC0, etc)
- be released on curseforge and have at least a million downloads
- don't depend on a bullshit library mod (defined as a mod you released on curseforge that adds no features when installed alone and is only depended on by your own mods)

## Cost

- add me to your project's curseforge 
- give me 10% of the curseforge points generated per version of MC ported across (ex. 1.16.5 -> 1.18.2 = 20%) plus 10% if ported to the other mod loader
