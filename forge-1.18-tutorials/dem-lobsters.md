# Dem Lobsters Integration 

[Dem Lobsters](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dem-lobsters) is a mod that allows you to breed colourful lobsters 
and use their shells to craft resources instead of mining. It is similar to Mystical Agriculture. 
You can improve your mod by adding compatibility with Dem Lobsters!

Unfortunatly, Dem Lobsters has not been updated to 1.18 yet ([read 1.16.5 tutorial instead](/o16/dem-lobsters)). This may change in the future, thanks for your patience. Join [the discord server](https://discord.gg/VbZVnRd) or [the email list](https://buttondown.email/LukeGrahamLandry) to be notified when the mod is updated.
